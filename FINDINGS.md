# Marketing Cost Curves: Key Findings

## Executive Summary

Marketing spend shows **strong diminishing returns** - early dollars are 10x more efficient than late dollars. Spread levels have an **even larger impact** on contract volume than marketing spend, with a 500 bps spread reduction roughly doubling contracts at any spend level.

## 1. Diminishing Returns on Marketing Spend

At the current ~11.27% spread level (closest to 11.39% in model):

| Spend Level | Contracts | mCAC (marginal) | iCAC (blended) |
|-------------|-----------|-----------------|----------------|
| $0M | 18,485 | — | — |
| $10M | 20,581 | $4.8K | $4.8K |
| $20M | 21,838 | $8.0K | $6.0K |
| $40M | 23,514 | $9.6K | $8.0K |
| $80M | 26,028 | $18.7K | $10.6K |
| $150M | 29,067 | $47.1K | $14.2K |

**Key insight:** The first $10M of spend acquires contracts at ~$4.8K each. The last $10M (from $140M to $150M) acquires contracts at ~$47K each - nearly **10x less efficient**.

## 2. Spread Impact Dominates Marketing Spend

At $40M marketing spend:

| Spread | Contracts | vs 17.39% baseline |
|--------|-----------|-------------------|
| 11.39% | 23,514 | +198% (3.0x) |
| 12.39% | 19,595 | +149% (2.5x) |
| 13.39% | 16,329 | +107% (2.1x) |
| 14.39% | 13,608 | +73% (1.7x) |
| 15.39% | 11,340 | +44% (1.4x) |
| 16.39% | 9,450 | +20% (1.2x) |
| 17.39% | 7,875 | baseline |

**Key insight:** A 100 bps spread reduction delivers **~15-25% more contracts** depending on starting point. This is equivalent to $20-40M of incremental marketing spend.

## 3. Efficient Spend Zones

Using 2% of home price ($7.5K at $375K ASP) as the efficiency threshold:

### At 11.39% Spread (most competitive)
- **Green zone (≤2%):** $0-25M spend
- **Yellow zone (2-4%):** $25-70M spend
- **Red zone (>4%):** $70M+ spend

### At 14.39% Spread (mid-range)
- **Green zone:** $0-15M spend
- **Yellow zone:** $15-45M spend
- **Red zone:** $45M+ spend

### At 17.39% Spread (least competitive)
- **Green zone:** $0-10M spend
- **Yellow zone:** $10-30M spend
- **Red zone:** $30M+ spend

**Key insight:** Lower spreads extend the efficient spend zone significantly. At 11.39% spread, you can spend 2.5x more before hitting diminishing returns vs 17.39% spread.

## 4. Trade-off Analysis: Spread vs Marketing Spend

To achieve **25,000 contracts**:

| Strategy | Spread | Marketing Spend | Total Cost* |
|----------|--------|-----------------|-------------|
| A: Competitive pricing | 11.39% | $55M | $55M + spread cost |
| B: Moderate pricing | 13.39% | $95M | $95M + spread cost |
| C: Premium pricing | 15.39% | Not achievable | — |

*Does not include margin impact of spread changes

**Key insight:** At higher spreads, there's a ceiling on achievable contracts regardless of marketing spend. The 17.39% spread curve maxes out at ~9,700 contracts even at $150M spend.

---

## 5. Organic Baseline (Zero Marketing Spend)

Contracts generated with $0 marketing spend represent organic/baseline demand:

| Spread | Organic Contracts |
|--------|-------------------|
| 11.39% | 18,485 |
| 13.39% | 12,837 |
| 15.39% | 8,915 |
| 17.39% | 6,191 |

**Key insight:** Spread alone accounts for a **3x difference** in organic contracts (18.5K vs 6.2K). This baseline shifts the entire cost curve up or down.

---

## 6. Implications for Budget Planning

1. **Front-load efficiency:** First $20-30M of spend has 2-3x better ROI than incremental dollars above $80M

2. **Spread is the bigger lever:** 200 bps of spread improvement delivers more contracts than doubling marketing spend from $40M to $80M

3. **Diminishing returns accelerate:** mCAC increases roughly 50% for each $20M increment above $60M

4. **Set spend based on spread strategy:** If competing on price (low spread), higher marketing budgets remain efficient. If maintaining margins (high spread), marketing dollars hit diminishing returns faster.
