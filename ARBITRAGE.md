# Spread vs Marketing Spend Arbitrage Analysis

## The Core Question

If you can either reduce spreads (costing margin) or increase marketing spend, which delivers more contracts per dollar?

---

## 1. Exchange Rate: Spread bps ↔ Marketing $M

At each spread level, how much marketing spend equals 100 bps of spread reduction?

| Starting Spread | Contracts at $40M | Contracts w/ -100bps | Δ Contracts | Marketing $ for same Δ |
|-----------------|-------------------|----------------------|-------------|------------------------|
| 17.39% → 16.39% | 7,875 | 9,450 | +1,575 | ~$50M |
| 16.39% → 15.39% | 9,450 | 11,340 | +1,890 | ~$55M |
| 15.39% → 14.39% | 11,340 | 13,608 | +2,268 | ~$60M |
| 14.39% → 13.39% | 13,608 | 16,329 | +2,721 | ~$70M |
| 13.39% → 12.39% | 16,329 | 19,595 | +3,266 | ~$85M |
| 12.39% → 11.39% | 19,595 | 23,514 | +3,919 | ~$110M |

**Key insight:** 100 bps of spread reduction is worth **$50-110M of marketing spend** depending on your starting point. The value increases at lower spreads because you're multiplying against a larger base.

## 2. Marginal Efficiency by Lever

### Marketing Spend Efficiency (contracts per $5M)
At 13.39% spread:

| Spend Tranche | Δ Contracts | Contracts/$M |
|---------------|-------------|--------------|
| $0 → $5M | +728 | 146 |
| $20 → $25M | +437 | 87 |
| $40 → $45M | +350 | 70 |
| $60 → $65M | +263 | 53 |
| $80 → $85M | +219 | 44 |
| $100 → $105M | +194 | 39 |

### Spread Reduction Efficiency (contracts per 100bps)
At $40M spend:

| Spread Change | Δ Contracts | Contracts/100bps |
|---------------|-------------|------------------|
| 17.39% → 16.39% | +1,575 | 1,575 |
| 16.39% → 15.39% | +1,890 | 1,890 |
| 15.39% → 14.39% | +2,268 | 2,268 |
| 14.39% → 13.39% | +2,721 | 2,721 |
| 13.39% → 12.39% | +3,266 | 3,266 |
| 12.39% → 11.39% | +3,919 | 3,919 |

## 3. The Efficient Frontier

### When to prioritize SPREAD REDUCTION:
- When spread is >14% (high margin, low conversion regime)
- When marketing spend is already >$60M (deep in diminishing returns)
- When you need large contract gains (>2,000 incremental)

### When to prioritize MARKETING SPEND:
- When spread is <12% (already competitive, marketing multiplies well)
- When marketing spend is <$30M (still in efficient zone)
- When margin preservation is critical

## 4. Optimal Paths to Target Contract Levels

### Target: 20,000 contracts

| Path | Spread | Marketing | Total "Cost" | Notes |
|------|--------|-----------|--------------|-------|
| A: Spread-first | 12.39% | $15M | 439 bps reduction + $15M | Most margin-intensive |
| B: Balanced | 13.39% | $45M | 339 bps reduction + $45M | Middle ground |
| C: Marketing-first | 14.39% | $85M | 239 bps reduction + $85M | Most cash-intensive |
| D: Extreme marketing | 15.39% | Not achievable | — | Curve maxes at ~19K |

### Target: 25,000 contracts

| Path | Spread | Marketing | Notes |
|------|--------|-----------|-------|
| A: Spread-first | 11.39% | $55M | Only path that works efficiently |
| B: High marketing | 12.39% | $110M | Possible but deep in red zone |
| C: Higher spreads | 13.39%+ | Not achievable | Curves max out below 25K |

## 5. Break-Even Analysis

### Cost of 100bps spread reduction:
- At $375K ASP: $3,750 margin reduction per home
- At 20,000 contracts/year: **$75M annual margin impact**
- At 25,000 contracts/year: **$93.75M annual margin impact**

### Equivalent marketing spend for same contracts:
- 100bps at 15% spread = ~$55M marketing (one-time) for +1,890 contracts
- Those contracts generate: 1,890 × $375K × (remaining margin) in GMV

### Break-even calculation:
If 100bps costs $75M/year in margin but saves $55M in marketing:
- **Net cost: $20M/year** for the spread approach
- But spread reduction is **permanent** (structural) while marketing is **ongoing**

## 6. Recommended Strategy by Scenario

### Scenario A: Maximize contracts, margin flexible
**Recommendation:** Drive spread to 11-12% range, then layer marketing to $40-60M
- Contracts achievable: 24,000-27,000
- Spread provides the foundation; marketing fine-tunes

### Scenario B: Maximize contracts, margin constrained
**Recommendation:** Hold spread at 14-15%, push marketing to $60-80M
- Contracts achievable: 14,000-16,000
- Accept lower volume ceiling in exchange for margin preservation

### Scenario C: Balanced growth
**Recommendation:** Target 13% spread with $40-50M marketing
- Contracts achievable: 17,000-18,000
- Moderate margin impact with reasonable marketing efficiency

## 7. The "Cliff" Effect

Critical observation: **At spreads above 15%, marketing spend has a hard ceiling.**

| Spread | Max Contracts (at $150M spend) | Ceiling |
|--------|-------------------------------|---------|
| 11.39% | 29,067 | — |
| 13.39% | 20,185 | — |
| 15.39% | 14,017 | ⚠️ |
| 17.39% | 9,734 | ⚠️ |

At 17.39% spread, you **cannot** reach 15,000 contracts regardless of marketing spend. The spread creates a structural ceiling that no amount of marketing can overcome.

---

## Summary

1. **100 bps of spread = $50-110M of marketing spend** in contract impact
2. **Spread reduction is more powerful at lower spreads** (larger multiplier base)
3. **Marketing efficiency drops sharply above $60M** at any spread level
4. **High spreads create contract ceilings** that marketing cannot break
5. **Optimal strategy:** Reduce spread to unlock volume potential, then apply marketing dollars in the efficient zone ($20-50M)
