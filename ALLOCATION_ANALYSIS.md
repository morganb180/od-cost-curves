# Marketing vs Spread Subsidy: Optimal Budget Allocation

## The Trade-off

You have two levers to acquire contracts:
1. **Marketing spend** - advertising to drive seller leads
2. **Spread subsidy** - better offers to convert more sellers

## Current State

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Current spread | 11.27% (1127.39 bps) |
| Target spread | 9.75% (975 bps) |
| Gap | 152 bps |

## Pricing Partner's Subsidy Economics

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Subsidy per $1M/month | 90 bps spread reduction |
| To close 152 bps gap | $1.69M/month |
| **Annual subsidy cost** | **$20M** |

## Recommended Allocation ($45M Total Budget)

| Allocation | Amount | What It Does |
|------------|--------|--------------|
| **Pricing subsidy** | **$20M** | Reduces spread 11.27% → 9.75% |
| **Marketing** | **$25M** | Acquires contracts at efficient mCAC |

## The Math

```
Gap to close:     152 bps
Rate:             90 bps per $1M/month
Monthly cost:     152 ÷ 90 = $1.69M/month
Annual cost:      $1.69M × 12 = ~$20M/year
```

## Expected Impact

| Scenario | Contracts |
|----------|-----------|
| 11.27% spread + $25M marketing | ~22,000 |
| 9.75% spread + $25M marketing | ~27,000 |
| **Extra contracts from subsidy** | **~5,000** |

### Unit Economics

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Subsidy spend | $20M |
| Extra contracts | 5,000 |
| **Cost per extra contract** | **$4,000** |

This $4K/contract via subsidy compares favorably to marginal marketing CAC at higher spend levels ($8-10K+).

## Why This Works

1. **Subsidy is more efficient than marginal marketing** - At $25M+ marketing spend, mCAC exceeds $4K. Subsidy beats it.

2. **Marketing stays in efficient zone** - The first $25M of marketing has mCAC under $4K. Keep spending there.

3. **Spread unlocks volume** - The 152 bps reduction opens up ~5,000 incremental contracts that marketing alone couldn't reach efficiently.

## Marketing Efficiency Reference

At 9.75% spread (post-subsidy):

| Marketing Spend | Marginal Contracts/$1M | mCAC |
|-----------------|------------------------|------|
| $0-10M | ~500+ | <$2K |
| $10-20M | ~350 | ~$2.9K |
| $20-30M | ~250 | ~$4K |
| $30M+ | <200 | >$5K |

With $25M marketing at 9.75% spread, you're staying in the efficient zone while the subsidy does the heavy lifting on volume.

## Summary

**Give pricing $20M** to close the 152 bps spread gap (11.27% → 9.75%).

**Keep $25M for marketing** in the efficient mCAC zone.

**Result:** ~5,000 extra contracts at $4K/contract via subsidy, plus efficient marketing spend at the lower spread.
