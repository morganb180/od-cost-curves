# Marketing vs Spread Subsidy: Optimal Budget Allocation

## The Trade-off

You have two levers to acquire contracts:
1. **Marketing spend** - advertising to drive seller leads
2. **Spread subsidy** - better offers to convert more sellers

## Pricing Partner's Subsidy Economics

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Subsidy per $1M | 90 bps spread reduction |
| Incremental contracts per $1M | ~300 |
| **Cost per contract via subsidy** | **$3,333** |

At $375K ASP, 1 bp = $37.50/contract. So 90 bps = $3,375/contract.

## Marketing Efficiency by Spend Level

At ~11.75% baseline spread:

| Marketing Spend | Marginal Contracts/$1M | mCAC | vs Subsidy |
|-----------------|------------------------|------|------------|
| $0-5M | ~520 | $1.9K | Marketing wins |
| $5-10M | ~420 | $2.4K | Marketing wins |
| $10-15M | ~310 | $3.2K | **≈ Crossover** |
| $15-20M | ~250 | $4.0K | Subsidy wins |
| $20-30M | ~180 | $5.6K | Subsidy wins |
| $30-50M | ~120 | $8.3K | Subsidy wins |
| $50M+ | <100 | $10K+ | Subsidy wins |

## Recommended Allocation

**If targeting ~$45M total acquisition budget:**

| Allocation | Amount | Rationale |
|------------|--------|-----------|
| Marketing | **$15-20M** | Stay in efficient zone (mCAC < $3.3K) |
| Spread Subsidy | **$25-30M** | More efficient beyond crossover |

### What This Achieves

**$25M subsidy impact:**
- At ~30,000 expected contracts: $25M / 30,000 = $833/contract
- Spread reduction: $833 / $37.50 = **~22 bps**
- e.g., from 11.75% → 11.53% effective spread

**Wait - that's only 22 bps, not the 200 bps to get to 9.75%...**

## The Reality Check ⚠️

To reduce spread from 11.75% to 9.75% (200 bps) across 30,000 contracts:
- Cost = 30,000 × 200 × $37.50 = **$225M**

This is the full margin cost of a 200 bps spread reduction at scale.

Your pricing partner's "$1M → 300 contracts" may represent:
1. A specific market/segment, not company-wide
2. Incremental contracts from spread reduction (not total)
3. A different interpretation of the economics

## Revised Analysis: Marginal Reallocation

If we interpret "$1M → 300 contracts" as **incremental contracts from spread reduction**:

At the margin, compare:
- **Marketing**: 100-150 contracts per $1M (at $40M+ spend level)
- **Subsidy**: 300 contracts per $1M (per pricing partner)

**Subsidy is 2-3x more efficient at the margin!**

### Optimal Strategy

Given $45M total budget:

| Phase | Spend On | Amount | Cumulative Contracts |
|-------|----------|--------|---------------------|
| 1 | Marketing (efficient zone) | $15M | +3,500 |
| 2 | Subsidy reallocation | $25M | +7,500 |
| 3 | Marketing (moderate zone) | $5M | +800 |
| **Total** | | **$45M** | **+11,800** |

vs. all-marketing approach:
| All Marketing | $45M | +6,000 |

**The hybrid approach yields ~2x the incremental contracts!**

## Sensitivity: What If Subsidy Contracts/$ Varies?

| Subsidy Efficiency | Optimal Marketing | Optimal Subsidy |
|--------------------|-------------------|-----------------|
| 200 contracts/$1M | $20-25M | $20-25M |
| 300 contracts/$1M | $15-20M | $25-30M |
| 400 contracts/$1M | $10-15M | $30-35M |

## Key Insight

The **$25M to pricing** estimate is in the right ballpark if:
- Subsidy yields ~300 contracts per $1M
- You want to keep ~$15-20M in marketing for brand/awareness and efficient early-funnel spend
- Total budget is ~$45M

This shifts the operating point closer to the efficient frontier while recognizing that some marketing spend (the first $15-20M) is still more efficient than subsidy.
